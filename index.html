                Hello! My name is Charlie Blodgett. I am the 4th of 9 children. I currently live in Provo, Utah, and am attending BYU as a Cybersecurity Major.
            </p>
            <p>
                I <em>LOVE</em> everything about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My greatest goal in life is to make and keep sacred covenants with my Savior and eventually my eternal companion.

            <p>
                Where do I begin?! There are <strong>SO</strong> many beautiful things in this world God has given us. Perhaps the one I am most passionate is the gift of music and dance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I LOVE to dance!! I began my senior year of highschool by taking a contemporary and ballroom dance class. I was injured before being able to perform in ballroom, and then served my mission and left dance behind for more joyful things. But since returning home I have been blessed to join <em>FOLK DANCE!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to play piano and sing!! I am always singing, whether in my head or outloud. I don't have many moments without a soundtrack. I also feel alive when I play a piano song that rings with my heart and emotions. I love hymn arrangments!

                Family
            </h2>
            <p>
                I love my family!!! My mother is the most spiritual person I know. She sacrifices so much to support and love and care for my siblings and I. She shares her testimony with her whole heart and soul, and it has been a crucial part of my own desire to have one. I love her!
            </p>
            <p>
                My Dad is the strong and faithful priesthood holder that our family needed when my mom was raising 4 kids on her own, and he loves my mom with all his heart. He loves my mom as hiself. He has had his share of trials in his life but remains firm in what he knows to be true. I love his steady, calm, and kind example!
            </p>
            <p>My siblings are incredible! Rebecca can crack anybody up, Shari is kind no matter who it is, Adrian is passionate and diligent, Donald is a peacemaker, Jared is the best kind of goofball, Samuel is sharp as a knife, Edythe is a bundle of Joy, and Mary could pick me up and set me on the fridge for a timeout if she wanted to. I love all of them!</p>
